            One of the main problems in the study of human migration is predicting how many people will migrate from one place to another. An important model used for this problem is the radiation model for human migration, which models locations as attractors whose attractiveness is moderated by distance as well as attractiveness of neighboring locations. In the model, the measure used for attractiveness is population which is a proxy for economic opportunities and jobs. However, this may not be valid, for example, in developing countries, and fails to take into account people migrating for non-economic reasons such as quality of life. Here, we extend the radiation model to include the number of amenities (offices, schools, leisure places, etc.) as features aside from population. We find that the generalized radiation model outperforms the radiation model by as much as 10.3\% relative improvement in mean absolute percentage error based on actual census data five years apart. The best performing model does not even include population information which suggests that amenities already include the information that we get from population. The generalized radiation model provides a measure of feature importance thus presenting another avenue for investigating the effect of amenities on human migration.},

With reference to the theory of Support Vector Machine and Genetic Algorithm, a new short-term passenger flow prediction model is built employing LSSVM, and a new evaluation indicator is used for presenting training permanence. An improved genetic algorithm is designed by enhancing crossover and variation in the use of optimizing the penalty parameter γ and kernel parameter s in LS-SVM. By using this method, passenger flow in a certain bus route is predicted in Changchun. The obtained result shows that there is little difference between actual value and prediction, and the majority of the equal coefficients of a training set are larger than 0.90, which shows the validity of the approach.},

	abstract = {Understanding the relationship between short-term subway ridership and its influential factors is crucial to improving the accuracy of short-term subway ridership prediction. Although there has been a growing body of studies on short-term ridership prediction approaches, limited effort is made to investigate the short-term subway ridership prediction considering bus transfer activities and temporal features. To fill this gap, a relatively recent data mining approach called gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) is applied to short-term subway ridership prediction and used to capture the associations with the independent variables. Taking three subway stations in Beijing as the cases, the short-term subway ridership and alighting passengers from its adjacent bus stops are obtained based on transit smart card data. To optimize the model performance with different combinations of regularization parameters, a series of GBDT models are built with various learning rates and tree complexities by fitting a maximum of trees. The optimal model performance confirms that the gradient boosting approach can incorporate different types of predictors, fit complex nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle the multicollinearity effect with high accuracy. In contrast to other machine learning methods—or “black-box” procedures—the GBDT model can identify and rank the relative influences of bus transfer activities and temporal features on short-term subway ridership. These findings suggest that the GBDT model has considerable advantages in improving short-term subway ridership prediction in a multimodal public transportation system.},

            Understanding spatial interactions such as human mobility has been one of the main analytical themes in geography, spatial economics, and traffic engineering for a long time. The intervening opportunities models, including the radiation model, provide a framework to elucidate spatial interactions generated by an individual’s distance-ordered decision-making process. However, such classical definitions of intervening opportunities have often failed to predict realistic flow volumes, particularly for short-distance flows. To overcome this problem, we have proposed a new formulation of intervening opportunities with a kernel function to introduce a fuzziness in spatial search behaviours of destinations, to develop a new variant of the radiation model. The mobility patterns resulting from the modified radiation model that included kernel-based intervening opportunities outperformed the original radiation model when fitted to four datasets of inter-regional flows.},

Building management is one of the processes on which numerous studies have been conducted to assist building users. Thailand has progressed in terms of transportation infrastructure and public transportation. The Metropolitan Rapid Transit (MRT) system has more than one hundred million users per year. However, crowding is a concern in the present since crowding creates a problem and reduces customer pleasure. The goal of this research is to create a machine learning model for forecasting passenger demand over time. In addition, standard data collecting equipment was used to collect data from the Metropolitan Rapid Transit (MRT) Purple Line. This line has a total of 16 stations. Station name, date, day, month, period, number of passengers, holidays, weekends, and weather are among the nine factors. Analysis approaches included the analysis phase, classification, and regression algorithm. However, the regression algorithm’s accuracy is poor and therefore cannot be used. Before using machine learning classification methods, the K-means was used to cluster the types of passengers. In addition, for this investigation, three classification methods were used: artificial neural network, random forest, and decision tree. Furthermore, the findings revealed that the artificial neural network has a high predicting accuracy. The accuracy value stated is more than 0.85 for demand over time.},

However, the models, to our knowledge, have never been compared with respect to policy testing scenarios. For this reason, here we use the models to analyse the impact of the introduction of a new transportation network, a bus rapid transport system, in the city of Teresina in Brazil. We do this by measuring the estimated variation in the trip distribution, and formulate an accessibility to employment indicator for the different zones of the city. By comparing the results obtained with the two approaches, we are able to not only better assess the goodness of fit and the impact of this intervention, but also understand reasons for the systematic similarities and differences in their predictions.},

However, researchers from different fields tend to employ their own unique research paradigms and lack interdisciplinary communication, preventing the cross-fertilization of knowledge and the development of novel solutions to challenges. This article presents a systematic interdisciplinary survey that comprehensively and holistically scrutinizes OD flows from utilizing fundamental theory to studying the mechanism of population mobility and solving practical problems with engineering techniques, such as computational models. Specifically, regional economics, urban geography, and sociophysics are adept at employing theoretical research methods to explore the underlying mechanisms of OD flows. They have developed three influential theoretical models: the gravity model, the intervening opportunities model, and the radiation model. These models specifically focus on examining the fundamental influences of distance, opportunities, and population on OD flows, respectively. In the meantime, fields such as transportation, urban planning, and computer science primarily focus on addressing four practical problems: OD prediction, OD construction, OD estimation, and OD forecasting. Advanced computational models, such as deep learning models, have gradually been introduced to address these problems more effectively. Finally, based on the existing research, this survey summarizes current challenges and outlines future directions for this topic. Through this survey, we aim to break down the barriers between disciplines in OD flow-related research, fostering interdisciplinary perspectives and modes of thinking.},

            The movements of individuals within and among cities influence critical aspects of our society, such as well-being, the spreading of epidemics, and the quality of the environment. When information about mobility flows is not available for a particular region of interest, we must rely on mathematical models to generate them. In this work, we propose Deep Gravity, an effective model to generate flow probabilities that exploits many features (e.g., land use, road network, transport, food, health facilities) extracted from voluntary geographic data, and uses deep neural networks to discover non-linear relationships between those features and mobility flows. Our experiments, conducted on mobility flows in England, Italy, and New York State, show that Deep Gravity achieves a significant increase in performance, especially in densely populated regions of interest, with respect to the classic gravity model and models that do not use deep neural networks or geographic data. Deep Gravity has good generalization capability, generating realistic flows also for geographic areas for which there is no data availability for training. Finally, we show how flows generated by Deep Gravity may be explained in terms of the geographic features and highlight crucial differences among the three considered countries interpreting the model’s prediction with explainable AI techniques.},

The need for this change of emphasis is demonstrated by the results of an empirical study of a selection of nine spatial-interaction models. Not only do the theory-based models fail to achieve significantly better levels of performance than some empirically derived models, but both types of model fail to achieve satisfactory levels of descriptive performance. These models are shown to be sensitive to the choice of calibration procedure and various kinds of errors in the constant and independent variables. It is suggested that the use of these models should always be accompanied by estimates of confidence limits, and that there is an urgent need for the development of new model designs which can at least provide accurate descriptions of observed reality.},
